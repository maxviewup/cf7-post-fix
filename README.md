# Contact Form 7 Post Special Tag Fix

This plugins fix the CF7 PostsSpecial tags ([_post_name], [_post_title], etc).

Currently, those tags only work when The contact Form is inside an Post Content. They doesn't work on Widgets or outside the post list.

This plugin will allow you to use the Special Tags from everywhere (widgets, custom code, etc). You will be able to see the current post info on your emails.

Note that this will work only if the user is in an post (Front Page, Blog Page, Posts, Pages and Custom Posts). If the user is on an archive, the behavior will be the current.
